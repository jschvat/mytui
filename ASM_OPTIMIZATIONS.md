# Assembly Optimizations for TUI Framework

## 🚀 Performance Analysis Results

The benchmark shows significant optimization potential with assembly-level improvements to the TUI framework.

### Current Performance Baseline
- **Mouse parsing**: 19 CPU cycles per parse (100k parses in 655μs)
- **Buffer rendering**: 46,885 cycles per frame (66,666 FPS without actual output)
- **Memory operations**: 1.22x speedup already achieved with basic SIMD

### CPU Feature Support
- ✅ **SSE2**: Available for 16-byte SIMD operations
- ✅ **AVX**: Available for 32-byte SIMD operations  
- ✅ **AVX2**: Available for enhanced integer SIMD operations

## 🔥 Key Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Mouse Input Processing (Highest Impact)
**Current**: Sequential character-by-character parsing
**Optimized**: SIMD pattern matching

```cpp
// Current approach
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    if (buffer[i] == 'q' || buffer[i] == 'Q') {
        found_quit = true;
    }
}

// SIMD approach (implemented)
__m128i quit_pattern = _mm_set1_epi8('q');
__m128i chunk = _mm_loadu_si128((const __m128i*)(buffer + i));
__m128i quit_cmp = _mm_cmpeq_epi8(chunk, quit_pattern);
if (_mm_movemask_epi8(quit_cmp) != 0) {
    found_quit = true;
}
```

**Expected Speedup**: 4-8x faster for mouse input processing

### 2. Buffer Rendering (Medium Impact)
**Current**: String comparisons and concatenations per cell
**Potential**: Vectorized color comparison and batch string operations

```cpp
// Optimization potential
- Batch color comparisons using SIMD
- Optimized string concatenation with vectorized memcpy
- Loop unrolling for common terminal sizes (80x24, 120x30)
- Cache-friendly memory access patterns
```

**Expected Speedup**: 2-4x faster for large screen updates

### 3. Memory Operations (Medium Impact)
**Current**: Standard library memset/memcpy
**Implemented**: SIMD-aligned memory operations

Already showing **1.22x speedup** with basic SIMD implementation.

**Expected Speedup**: 2-3x with fully optimized implementations

### 4. Box Drawing (Low Impact)
**Current**: Individual setCell calls per border character
**Potential**: Batch line drawing with vectorized operations

```cpp
// Potential optimization
void fast_draw_horizontal_line_simd(char* row, int width, char pattern) {
    __m128i pattern_vec = _mm_set1_epi8(pattern);
    // Vectorized fill operation
}
```

**Expected Speedup**: 2-3x for large window operations
